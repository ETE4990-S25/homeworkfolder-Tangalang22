    "Create a Python script that recursively searches a file system for files with identical names. Perform a comparison on files and output the file paths of identical files.\n",

    "## Required tasks\n",
    "1. A menu\n",
    "- this should be fairly easy seeing as your games (should) already have a menu system\n",
    "2. Recursive Search\n",
    "- a recursive search is a search that will travel into a folder and back out.\n",
    "3. Comparison\n",
    "- I recommend using a check sum comparison operation like MD5 or SHA-256\n",
    "4. Output\n",
    "- the program will output files and there directories\n",
    "- this can be done live or after\n",
